Need to debug the weird ring.
Go through and binary search the commits for when it might have happened.

Happened after the commit for addition of the MainCharacter class and movement successful.
Happened before commit - "Collision detection is working"

Happened between commmits
-"Forgot to save project before committing" - works
-"Seems to still work" - ring - lol a little irony there :P

Error is in physics shape library and stuff. doesn't compile between these commits, but take particular look at changes introduced in Seems to still work.

Seems to have something to do with bullet emissions as it only appears around bullet emitters
Happens every "second" which is very odd.

Also periodic breaks in bullet output... doesn't appear to be an error in the trajectory class,
since all bullet emitters share the issue regardless of bullet's trajectories. Probably occurs below trajectory in commit
bullets disappear!!! they appear, but then disappear!!!

Most likely in MainForm.cs (if it is in MainForm, error did not occur this commit) or in BulletEmitter.cs
