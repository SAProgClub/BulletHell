Notes

Bug: Weird rings of bullets not being uncreated properly in rewind mode. Might have something to do with collisions immediately after creation.
Yup that's exactly it. Presumably creation occurs, collision occurs *at the same time* they end up in reverse order in the list so when rewinding,
attempts to uncreate and then collision attempts to undelete. Wait that can't be it, I don't think, or the bullets would appear after being hit when unrewinding right?
Well we can check. Yeah no that doesn't seem to be it, besides Physics ought to happen the frame after bullet creation... so anyway. Definitely related
though cause that's when it happens when I'm testing. No it is actually rewinding create before destroy... that's odd. Yep then it destroys it before creation.

Solution: Idk yet. Probably just have the thing check to see whether it's supposed to be visible before adds

Plans

-Debug ring of bullets. - Done 3 December 2013
-Turn keypresses into GameEvents - Done 4 December 2013
-Actually use the rewinding vs. undo feature - Done 4 December 2013
-Complicated Entity lifetimes/paths
-Levels
-Read entities/levels in from files
