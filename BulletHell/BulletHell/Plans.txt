Notes

Need to debug the weird ring.
Go through and binary search the commits for when it might have happened.

Happened after the commit for addition of the MainCharacter class and movement successful.
Happened before commit - "Collision detection is working"

Happened between commmits
-"Forgot to save project before committing" - works
-"Collision detection is working" - ring

Seems to have something to do with bullet emissions as it only appears around bullet emitters
Happens every "second" which is very odd.

Plans

-Debug ring of bullets.
-Turn keypresses into GameEvents
-Actually use the rewinding vs. undo feature
