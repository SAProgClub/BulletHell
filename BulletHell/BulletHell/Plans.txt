Notes

Need to debug the weird ring.
Go through and binary search the commits for when it might have happened.

Happened after the commit for addition of the MainCharacter class and movement successful.
Happened before commit - "Collision detection is working"

Seems to have something to do with bullet emissions as it only appears around bullet emitters
Happens every "second" which is very odd.

Plans

-Debug ring of bullets.
-Turn keypresses into GameEvents
-Actually use the rewinding vs. undo feature
